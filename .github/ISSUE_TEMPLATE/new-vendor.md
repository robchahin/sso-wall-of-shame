name: New vendor
about: I'd like to add a vendor but can't / won't submit a PR

---

**What is the vendor's name?**
e.g. Slack

**What is the vendor's pricing site?**
e.g. https://slack.com/pricing

**What is the base pricing? Use the lowest tier that looks sane for a small business customer, not free or personal tiers.**
e.g. $5 per user/month, $3.33 per instance/month

**What is the minimum pricing for SSO support?**
e.g. $10 per user/month, $6 per instance/month

**Does this pricing info come from a quote or other non-public source?**
If yes, we'll add a `pricing_source_info` note next to the source link (e.g. "Pricing comes from a quote").

**Are there any caveats we should add as a vendor note?**
e.g. "SSO price only becomes visible after signing up to the Pro plan." This will appear as an ⓘ icon next to the vendor name.

name: New vendor
about: I'd like to add a vendor but can't / won't submit a PR

**What is the vendor's name?**
e.g. Slack

**What is the vendor's pricing site?**
e.g. https://slack.com/pricing

**What is the base pricing? Use the lowest tier that looks sane for a small business customer, not free or personal tiers.**
e.g. $5 per user/month, $3.33 per instance/month

**Does this pricing info come from a quote or other non-public source?**
Add any additional pricing context here.

**Are there any caveats we should list in the footnotes?**
